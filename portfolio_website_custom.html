    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>
        Hello, I'm Venkata Surya Manikanta Grandhi, a passionate individual with a strong background in computer science. I am always eager to learn and grow through new challenges and experiences. My interests include cooking, playing sports like cricket, and, of course, catching up on some much-needed sleep!
    </p>
    <p>
        I have a solid technical background, with proficiency in programming languages like Python, C, HTML, SQL, and CSS. My project experience includes working as a Salesforce Developer Catalyst, where I developed Apex code for triggers and batch processes, as well as designed Lightning components to enhance user interfaces.

This chatbot can be integrated into the Universities Existing System, and can have features like Scheduling Appointments, Checking Application Status etc. Using Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning Algorithms, this chatbot will understand the user inputs, and will be responding accordingly. This will be integrated to a Database to provide updated information. The final goal of this chatbot is to enhance user experience, save time, reduce Load and Burden to the IT Department, and increase operational efficiency.</p>
